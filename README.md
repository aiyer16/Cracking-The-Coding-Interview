# Cracking-The-Coding-Interview

This repository contains code for the topics discussed in Cracking the Coding Interview (6th Edition) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell along with other interview prep material around data structures and alogrithms. The motivation behind this project is to:

- Improving my own skills on key topics of data structures and algorithms
- Provide a reference to others preparing for interviews
